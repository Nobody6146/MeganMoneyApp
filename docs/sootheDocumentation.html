                <h3>What is Soothe?</h3>
                <p>
                    A light-weight and easy way frontend library for making dynamic html webpages and client side applications likes SPAs
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because SootheApp is library and not a framework, it can be dynamically added to any new or existing HTML page without side effects.
                    If SootheApp for some reason fails to execute properly, no weird HTML is displayed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's modular system allows you to select and combine the functionality you need to acheive your desired end result.
                    This means many things can be done several ways, and you are given the building blocks to custom tailor each solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SootheApp handles these 3 key features
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. Model binding</li>
                        <li>2. DOM manipulation</li>
                        <li>3. Client-side routing</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

                <h3>Design Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    Making dynamic webpages should be easy and hassle free. We shouldn't have to write complex JS queries and code to
                    manipulate our HTML or push data in and out of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a strong seperation of concerns. 
                    Lets worry about writting/designing our page in the HTML and CSS files only!
                    Likewise, we should only be writting our JavaScript in JS files and not mixing the two!
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML elements can spawn in the ways below
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. Setting HTML element attributes/properties</li>
                        <li>2. Adding/removing HTML elements</li>
                        <li>3. Calling/executing JS functions</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    SootheApp's models binding act as a communication layer/pipeline between our UI and app logic layers.
                    These modals are global where anything can read or write to and acts as a shared contract between contributors.
                    Everyone is reading/writing data as the same format, this makes communication easy!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>
                        NOTE: Models don't have to be used to communicate with app logic.
                        Models can also be used exclusively to store individual element state or communicate with our DOM elements
                    </i>

                <h3>What makes Soothe different?</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many popular front-end frameworks, but Soothe is unique with it's model binding and event based framework.
                    Here are a few of the differences between Soothe and other popular frameworks
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            1. The most popular frameworks like React or Angular require running a backend server or views/components to be compiled.
                            SootheApp is a client-side library which means no view building is  or backend is needed.
                            This means Soothe applications can actually be served over static filesystems.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2. Many of the client-side libraries such as Vue require knowing model properties and HTML nodes during initiation time.
                            Soothe app is 100% dynamic and things can be attached to the system at any point.
                            This means:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    a. Whenever an HTML element is added to the DOM, or is changed, it can immmediately trigger binding events and start responding to them
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    b. Whenever a JS callback is added, it will be immediately ready to start handling callbacks when events trigger
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    c. Whenever new models or model properties are bound, they will immediately trigger events
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <i>
                                        NOTE: This makes SootheApp really development friendly as you can easily use developer tools in browser
                                        to manipulate DOM and JS models to instally test changes without even reloading pages!

                                    </i>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            3. Many libraries generate ugly HTML documents with weird strings/characters being rendered in the actual HTML do to 
                            framework scripts not being processed/rendered properly, or even have missing HTML nodes.
                            Because SootheApp only uses standard html elements and custom attributes, no such side-effects exist
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            4. Many frameworks don't support 2-way model binding out of the box. SootheApp does.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>How does DOM manipulation and model binding work?</h3>
                <p>
                    Developers will determine a data structure for their application state and communication. This data is then bound to the Soothe
                    framework into a model. Any element via the DOM or JavaScript can read and write to this model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Changes to these models are automatically tracked by the framework and events are dispatched from the updates.
                    From here, HTML elements and JavaScript callback functions can subscribe to these events and respond to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML elements can spawn in the ways below
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. Setting HTML element attributes/properties</li>
                        <li>2. Adding/removing HTML elements</li>
                        <li>3. Calling/executing JS functions</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>NOTE: The scope of HMTL nodes SootheApp has access to is configurable</i>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>How does Client-side routing work?</h3>
                <p>
                    SootheApp has routing functions that can be manually called as well as the ability to integrates with your browser tab history.
                    This means that SootheApp can react to address changes and other navigation events and trigger actions via a middleware pipeline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The middleware pipeline use regex patterns to map middleware functions to routes inorder to respond to incoming routing request. 
                    A middleware step can choose to either continue running the next middleware or terminate the middleware execution process.
                    This gives developers the ability to run both intermidden services and resolve endpoints as needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During routing, route resolution information, route variables, object state, and the SootheApp context are all passed in to each piece of middleware called.
                    This should help cover any type of use cases needed when routing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Out-of-the-box, SootheApp comes with a basic configurable view rendering system.
                    Users can extend this system to easily create custom views that can be inserted into the middleware pipeline.
                    This view system allows easy for easy fetching and aggregation of HTML, JavaScript, and JS data into a single page.

                <p>
                    Getting started is easy. The only file we need is the Soothe JS file
                    Once you've done this, the following code will create an instance of SootheApp
                    <ul>
